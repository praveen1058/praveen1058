# 👋 Hi, I'm Praveen!

I'm a **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** with over **7+ years of experience** managing infrastructure on **AWS**. I specialize in building scalable, reliable, and automated solutions using DevOps and Cloud best practices.

> 🔒 Most of my professional work is under private company repositories, but I'm actively rebuilding my portfolio with personal projects using Terraform, Python, and AWS automation.
